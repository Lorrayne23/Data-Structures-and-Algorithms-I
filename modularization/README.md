Calculate the result of the following series for the first N terms, the value of N
must be read by keyboard:

1/2 + 1/4 - 2/6+ 3/8 − 5/10+ 8/12 - 13/14+ 21/16 − ...

Do this exercise in the following ways:
1 – in a main program

2 - using a procedure

3 - using global variables

4 – using global functions and variables

5 – using functions passing N as a parameter and returning the value

6 - using functions passing N as a parameter and returning the value in a
another parameter
