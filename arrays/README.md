1 - Write a program that reads a vector A with 15 integer elements. Construct a vector B of the same type, in
that each element of B must be the result of the corresponding factorial of each element of the matrix A. Present A and
B.

2 - Build a program that reads two vectors A and B with any 10 integer elements. Build a vector C,
this being the result of the union of the elements of A and B – without repetition. Introduce C.

3 - Write a program that reads 20 elements of real type in a vector A, then create a procedure that
invert the stored elements. That is, the first element of A will become the last, the second element
will become the penultimate one, and so on. Introduce A.

4 - Write a program that reads 10 elements of the integer type in an A vector. Create a 2-position ParImpar vector
and store in index 0 how many elements of A are even and in index 1 how many elements of A are odd. present the
even odd vector. Note: do not use the if conditional statement.

5 - Write a program that reads 10 elements of the integer type in a vector A. Sort and print the vector A.
