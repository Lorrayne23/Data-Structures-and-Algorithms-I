Write a C++ program to:
- Define a class to handle a bank account

 Attributes: customer code, customer name and bank balance.

- Create a constructor method passing the attributes by parameters, and another without parameters;

- A method for the class to deposit amount in the account balance

- A method for the class to withdraw account value â€“ the account cannot be negative!

- A method for the class to print an object

Create a program to instantiate two objects of this class (one using the constructor with parameters and the other object using the constructor without parameters) and print the data and the balance of these objects, then use the deposit method and print the objects again, now use the draw method and print the objects again.
